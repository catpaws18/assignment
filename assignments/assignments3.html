        I wanted to capture how time moves slowly aka "Chill Mode" before 2pm. But time moves quickly aka "Panic Mode" around 2pm when the evening deadline is nearing and you are focused like never before.

For this assignment, I first started out with understanding how to make a clock in p5.js. The most difficult part was to figure out how to manipulate speed of time when the clock hand is pointing certain angles. 

I took different approach to make the speed of the clock hand go faster when it angled between 40 degrees and 120 degrees if we consider 0 degrees as 12am/pm. I was able to make the speed go faster but the outcome didn't come out exactly like I had imagined it to be. 

Overall, I loved working with the concept of time during this project.
