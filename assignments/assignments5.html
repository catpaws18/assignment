    <h2>Assignment5 : Optical Illusion </h2>
    <p>I made Lenticular Art for the Optical Illusion assignment </p>

        I took example of various lenticular art where the changing patterns of the grid makes the object seem like it's moving. 
      I started out with for..loop and after multiple failed attempts, I had to manually put different numbers to see what will cause the grid to appear the way it appears now. 
      
      I also wanted to play around with an image so I chose an image of a person. I made the person and its shadow move with the position of mouseX so that it gives this 3D appearance of the person. The mouse movement also mixes the color of the back grid and front grid, giving it different colors each time you stop mouseX and mouseY movement.
