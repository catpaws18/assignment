    <h2>Assignment4 : Exquisite Corpse </h2>
    <p>With my two other partner, we had to change different sketches to create an exquisite corpse with a background story. </p>

        The original story of Dodo and Pirate is slightly similar in a way that they both had hardship in their lives -- one of them lost their eggs because of Dutch pigs and the other had to mutilate its hand because a wooden crate fell on its hand and decided to live as a pirate. 
The bunny is a carcass left on the street to rot. I wanted to combine all three stories where they had lots of trauma.The trauma made them into a monster which is why the dodo's head is on the hand moving and the blood is still dropping from the neck. Can trauma and pain make people into something they are not? That's what I wanted to explore with this combination of different parts.
