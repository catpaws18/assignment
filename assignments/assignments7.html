        My game is based on a festival called Rato Macchindranath Jatra in Nepal. It's a 10-day festival, celebrated by the indigenous community of Kathmandu valley in Nepal to bring rain to the valley. There are many rituals associated with the festival but the main one is to climb a long tree that has been placed on top of the chariot and throw a disc to predict the future. The chariot is also taken around the valley so that people could see the god and the chariot. They push the chariot through small alleyways.</p>
