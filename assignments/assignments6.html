    <h2>Assignment6 : Data Portrait </h2>
    <div class="paragraph-box"></div>
    <p>I wanted to track on which days of the week I cook all three meals and which days I eat leftover food or eat takeout food. </p>
  </p>
  </div>

    <div class="paragraph-box">
    <p>
      The days are listed on left hand Y axis and the cooking days are reflected by the blue pot and spatula that moves back and forth to make it as if the spatula is cooking something on the pot. 
      I don't think anything was lost during the process of data visualization but I can see how things are set in hard stone in coding that you have to give absolute values while making things. Through the process of self-tracking, I learned that I get tired of cooking by the end of the week and want to order in during weekend. A little reward for myself for getting through the week.
