        Heather lost her toy bunny in school when she was twenty years old. It was a medium sized grey bunny whose parts were shaped like an ellipse. The bunny usually sat in four legs upright position facing toward the front. It had brown, triangle shaped nose that pointed downwards with long ears with its inner ear pink in color and outward one in grey color. There were no whiskers on its face or textures on its body. 

        My interpretation and drawing: I guess we will never know where the bunny went. My interpretation is that the bunny snuck out of Heather's school and ran inside a small hole in the forest. I drew the bunny with cute little eyes and long feet and ears. 
        
        <p>While I could not achieve the exact sitting position, I stacked ellipses to give it an illusion of upright sitting position.</p>
