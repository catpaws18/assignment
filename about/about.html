        <p>In this rapidly evolving era, where technological advancements and societal changes often seem to follow a linear trajectory, I find myself grappling with a fundamental question: For whom are we designing and innovating? The pace of innovation is accelerating, yet the true purpose and context behind much of this design remain unclear. Are we creating for the benefit of society at large, or is the focus too often on profit, convenience, or personal gain? What are the broader implications of the choices we make as designers, and how do they impact the world we live in?

            This uncertainty is something I find deeply important to address, as I believe that design is not just about solving problems but also about understanding the problems we choose to tackle and the people we aim to serve. In exploring these complex questions, I am currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Design and Technology at The New School. The program allows me to engage critically with the intersection of creativity, technology, and social responsibility. It encourages me to explore how design can shape culture, influence behavior, and contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future. By pushing the boundaries of traditional design thinking, I seek to uncover new perspectives that challenge conventional approaches and empower meaningful innovation.
            
            Ultimately, my goal is to bridge the gap between technological advancement and human-centered design, ensuring that innovation serves the collective good and addresses the real needs of diverse communities. Through this exploration, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how to create designs that are not only functional but also ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible.</p>
